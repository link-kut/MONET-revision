In this section, we define terms that represent two types of ego networks of a node in a wireless network (Section~\ref{x-ego_definition}) as well as the betweenness of a node in its ego and x-ego networks (Section~\ref{betweenness}).
We then present several properties of the x-ego networks (Section~\ref{x-go_properties}).
Our betweenness computation algorithm in Section~\ref{computation} takes advantage of these properties.

\subsection{Definitions}\label{x-ego_definition}

% We assume that each DTN node has a fixed transmission range. If two nodes are within range of each other, they are said to be {\em neighbors} \cite{605303}, and a {\em contact} is defined as the status where two nodes are neighbors and can hence exchange data \cite{human_mobility,beyondDTN}. We assume that communication is bidirectional, though it may not be always true in practice due to interference, fades, and hidden nodes.
% 
% To describe our algorithm, we model DTN nodes' relationship as a graph $G(V, E)$, where $V$ is a set of vertices representing the nodes in the DTN and $E$ is a set of unweighted edges representing social links between nodes (see Fig.~\ref{eego} (a))\footnote{Hereinafter, we will use 'vertex' interchangeably with 'node', and 'edge' with 'link'.}. 
% These social links are usually inferred from the sequence of contacts over time in a contact trace. Different metrics such as aggregate contact duration \cite{IEEE:bubble}, contact frequency \cite{4146881,IEEE:bubble} or the age of last contact \cite{Dubois03} have been used to generate such links in the graph.

In this paper, we model a wireless network using a graph $G(V, E)$, where $V$ is a set of vertices representing the nodes in the network and $E$ is a set of edges representing social links between nodes (see Fig.~\ref{eego}).\footnote{We use the term {\em node} and {\em social link} to refer to the devices and their relationships in a wireless network. On the other hand, the graph representing a wireless network consists of {\em vertices} and {\em edges} representing nodes and social links, respectively.}
Given a pair of nodes that have communicated with each other, a social link between these nodes can be assumed if their communications meet certain criteria (e.g., the accumulated duration of communications~\cite{IEEE:bubble}, the frequency of  communications~\cite{4146881,IEEE:bubble}, or the elapsed time after the last communication is beyond/under a threshold~\cite{Dubois03}).
In this paper, we assume undirected social links among nodes (see Section~\ref{data_construction}).
Furthermore, we define the length of a path between two nodes as the number of social links on that path. 
In other words, we model a wireless network using an {\em undirected} and {\em unweighted} graph.

% For a given graph $G(V, E)$ and an arbitrary vertex $v$, let $V_{i}^{v}$ and $E_{i}^{v}$ denote the set of vertices whose shortest distance from $v$ is no larger than $i$ and the set of edges on shortest paths from $v$ to a node in $V_{i}^{v}$, respectively ($V_{0}^{v}=\{v\}$ and $E_{0}^{v}=\emptyset$). For $i\geq1$, the set of $i$-hop neighbors of $v$ is denoted as $N_{i}^{v}(=V_{i}^{v} - V_{i-1}^{v})$. We also denote the set of edges between an $i$-hop neighbor and a $j$-hop neighbor of $v$ as $E_{i \mhyphen j}^{v}$  ($E_{0 \mhyphen 0}^{v}=\emptyset$).
% 
% Using the above terms, a node $v$'s \emph{ego network}~\cite{egocentric,everett,ICCN:lbcdna,SIMBET}, denoted $\EN{v}$, can be defined as follows:
% \begin{definition}\label{def:ego-network}
% Given a graph $G(V, E)$ and a vertex $v \in V$, the \emph{ego network} of $v$ ($\EN{v}$) is the graph consisting of vertex $v$, $v$'s 1-hop neighbors, and the edges between them (i.e., $\EN{v} (V_{1}^{v}$, $E_{1}^{v} \cup E_{1 \mhyphen 1}^{v}$)).
% \end{definition}
% 
% For example, for a network given by Fig.~\ref{eego}~(a) and a vertex $0$, $V_{1}^{0}=\{0,1,2,3,4\}$, $E_{1}^{0}=\{(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4)\}$, and $E_{1 \mhyphen 1}^{0}=\{(1,2), (3,4)\}$. Therefore, the ego network of $0$ is $\EN{0} (V_{1}^{0}$, $E_{1}^{0} \cup E_{1 \mhyphen 1}^{0})=(\{0,1,2,3,4\}, \{(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(0,4),(1,2),(3,4)\})$, which is shown in Fig.~\ref{eego}~(b).

In the literature~\cite{egocentric, everett, ICCN:lbcdna, SIMBET}, given a graph $G(V, E)$ and a vertex $v \in V$, the {\em ego network} of $v$ is defined as the subgraph of $G$ consisting of $v$ and its 1-hop neighbors (i.e., vertices with an edge to $v$) as well as the edges between these vertices.
Using the notation summarized in Table~\ref{table:symbols}, this ego network can be formally defined as follows:

\begin{definition}\label{def:ego-network}
Given a graph $G(V, E)$ and a vertex $v \in V$, the \emph{ego network} of $v$ is defined as $\EN{v}(\LV{v}{1}, \LE{v}{1})$ where $\LV{v}{1}$ is the set of vertices whose shortest distance from $v$ is no longer than $1$ (i.e., $\{ v \} \cup \V{v}{1}$) and $\LE{v}{1}$ denotes the set of edges between the vertices in $\LV{v}{1}$.
\end{definition}

\vspace{-10mm}In Fig.~\ref{eego}, $\LV{v}{1} = \V{v}{0} \cup \V{v}{1} = \{v, a, b, c, d\}$ and $\LE{v}{1}=\{ \{v, a\}, \{v, b\}, \{v, c\}, \{v, d\},$ $\{a, b\}, \{c, d\} \}$.
The ego network of vertex $v$, $\EN{v}(\LV{v}{1}, \LE{v}{1})$, is shown in Fig.~\ref{eego2}(a).

% In a DTN, nodes usually broadcast its identifier and resources (such as buffer availability) to all neighboring nodes within their transmission range. These messages sent by a neighbor node $n$ may contain information about its 1-hop neighbors (i.e., $N_{1}^{n}$) to support sophisticated routing protocols \cite{605303,4698820}. A node $v$ receiving $N_{1}^{n}$ from each of its neighbor $n$ (i.e., $n \in {N_{1}^{v}}$) can infer the links between its 1-hop neighbors (i.e., $E_{0 \mhyphen 0}^{v}$), and obtain its ego network.
% 
% For example, assume that a node represented by vertex $0$ in Fig.~\ref{eego} (a) receives information about nodes $N_{1}^{1}=\{0, 2, 5, 6, 7\}$ from node $1$ and information about nodes $N_{1}^{2}=\{0, 1, 6\}$ from node $2$.
% In this case, node $0$ can infer the link represented by the edge between $1$ and $2$.
% Similarly, node $0$ can infer the link between $3$ and $4$ based on messages from $3$ and $4$.
% Then, node $0$ can obtain its ego network $\EN{0} (V_{1}^{v}$, $E_{1}^{0} \cup E_{1 \mhyphen 1}^{0})$.
In a wireless network, the ego network of each node (i.e., the ego network of the vertex representing that node) can be obtained if all of the nodes periodically broadcast information about their neighbors. 
For example, in the wireless network illustrated by Fig.~\ref{eego}, assume that nodes $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$  broadcast this information and node $v$ has been receiving such information. 
Then, node $v$ will be able to derive its ego network as in Fig.~\ref{eego2}(a).
% It should be noted that the ego network of $v$ does not fully capture the information received from $v$'s neighbors (i.e., misses the links between $v$'s 1-hop and 2-hop neighbors).
% If we fully integrate such information, we obtain the following, which we call {\em eXpanded ego (in short, x-ego) network}:
% \begin{definition}\label{def:xego-network}
% Given a graph $G(V, E)$ and a vertex $v \in V$, the \emph{eXpanded ego (x-ego) network} of $v$ ($\XN{v}$) is the graph consisting of $v$'s 1-hop and 2-hop neighbors, as well as the edges between $v$ and a 1-hop neighbor, between 1-hop and 2-hop neighbors, and between 1-hop neighbors (i.e., $\XN{v} (V_{2}^{v}$, $E_{2}^{v} \cup E_{1 \mhyphen 1}^{v}$)).
% \end{definition}

In the context of wireless networks, ego networks well model the relationships/interactions between a node and others.
However, ego networks have the limitation that it does not capture a substantial amount of information obtained at the expense of network resources.
For example, in Fig.~\ref{eego}, assume that node $v$ received from node $a$ the information about $a$'s 1-hop neighbors (i.e., $b$, $e$, $f$, $g$, and $v$).
Despite this information, the ego network of $v$ cannot record the social links between $a$ and $e$, between $a$ and $f$, and between $a$ and $g$ since it can represent only the social links between $v$ and the 1-hop neighbors of $v$.

To overcome the above limitation, we introduce the following extension to ego networks:

\begin{definition}\label{def:xego-network}
Given a graph $G(V, E)$ and a vertex $v \in V$, the \emph{extended ego network} (briefly, \emph{x-ego network}) of $v$ is $\XN{v} (\LV{v}{2}, \LE{v}{2} - \E{v}{2})$, where $\LV{v}{2}$ is the set of vertices that are at most 2 hops away from $v$, $\LE{v}{2}$ is the set of edges between vertices that are at most 2 hops away from $v$, and $\E{v}{2}$ is the set of edges between 2-hop neighbors of $v$.
\end{definition}

% For example, the x-ego network of the node represented by vertex 0 is  $\XN{0} (V_{2}^{0}$, $E_{2}^{0} \cup E_{1 \mhyphen 1}^{0})$ shown in Fig.~\ref{eego} (c). x-ego networks are different from 2nd order ego networks (or friends of friends) of which edge sets includes $E_{2 \mhyphen 2}^{v}$ as well as $E_{2}^{v} \cup E_{1 \mhyphen 1}^{v}$. 
% 
% Note that the vertex and edge sets of an x-ego network $\XN{v}$ for a vertex $v$ are also defined as follows:
% \begin{eqnarray}\label{chi}
% V_{2}^{v} &=& \bigcup_{n \in N_{1}^{v}} V_{1}^{n},\\
% E_{2}^{v} \cup E_{1 \mhyphen 1}^{v} &=& \bigcup_{n \in N_{1}^{v}} E_{1}^{n}.
% \end{eqnarray} It means that a vertex $v$ can generate its x-ego network by using the neighbor information of its neighbors. In summary, both ego and x-ego networks can be obtained with the same (similar) network overhead.
% However, expanded ego networks inherently contain substantially larger amounts of information than ego networks.
% As experimentally demonstrated in Section~\ref{experiments}, highly accurate betweenness centrality values can be obtained from x-ego networks than ego networks.

Fig.~\ref{eego2}(b) shows the x-ego network of $v$ from the graph in Fig.~\ref{eego}.
As Fig.~\ref{eego2}(a) and Fig.~\ref{eego2}(b) illustrate, the x-ego network of $v$ is different from the ego network of $v$ in that it contains 2-hop neighbors of $v$ (i.e., $\LV{v}{2} - \LV{v}{1} = \V{v}{2}$) as well as the edges between a 1-hop neighbor and a 2-hop neighbor of $v$.
Despite this difference, both the ego and x-ego networks of $v$ can be obtained with the same network overhead (since they consume the same messages from 1-hop neighbors of $v$).
The benefits of x-ego networks over ego networks are further verified in Section~\ref{evaluation}.

% For a given graph $G(V, E)$ and an arbitrary vertex $v$, we define the following terms:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item $V_{i}^{v}$: the set of vertices whose shortest distance from $v$ is no larger than $i$ (hence, $V_{0}^{v}=\{v\}$).
% \item $E_{i}^{v}$: the set of edges on shortest paths from $v$ to a node in $V_{i}^{v}$ (hence, $E_{0}^{v}=\emptyset$).
% \item $E_{i \mhyphen j}^{v}$: the set of edges between an $i$-hop neighbor and a $j$-hop neighbor of $v$ (hence, $E_{0 \mhyphen 0}^{v}=\emptyset$).
% \item $N_{i}$: the set of 1-hop neighbor nodes with a direct link to $v_i$.
% \item $E_{i}$: the set of links between $v_i$ to the nodes in $N_{i}$.
% \item $\bar{E}_{i}$: the set of links among the nodes in $N_{i}$.
% \end{itemize} 

%The ego network model has been frequently used in many network analysis. The ego network is the network consisting of a single node(ego) together with the 1st-hop neighbor nodes they are connected to and all the links among those neighbors.
% We also define the following additional terms:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item $N^{2}_{i}$: the set of $v_i$'s 2-hop neighbor nodes each of which has a direct link to a node in $N_{i}$.
% \item $E^{2}_{i}$: the set of links connecting the $N_{i}$ nodes to the $N^{2}_{i}$ nodes.
% %\item $\ddot{E}_{N^{2}_{i}}$: the set of edges of nodes belong to $N^{2}_{i}$.
% \end{itemize} 

\subsection{Ego and X-Ego Betweenness}\label{betweenness}

% In much literature, the betweenness $C_{B}(i)$ for a node $v$ has been formally defined as follows:\begin{equation}\label{bet}
% C_{B}(v) = \frac{\sum_{s \neq v \neq t \in V, s<t}\frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}}}{(n-1)(n-2)/2}.
% \end{equation} where $n$ is the total number of nodes, $\sigma_{st}$ is the number of shortest paths from $s$ to $t$, and $\sigma_{st}(i)$ is the number of those shortest paths that include the node $v$. In an undirected network, $\sigma_{st}=\sigma_{ts}$ and $\sigma_{st}(i)=\sigma_{ts}(i)$. The denominator denotes the total number of pairs of nodes except $v$ in an undirected network and normalizes $C_{B}(v)$ to a value between 0 and 1.

In the literature~\cite{centrality, everett, Brandes01afaster}, given a graph $G(V, E)$, the betweenness $\B{v}$ of a vertex $v$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}\label{bet}
\B{v} = \frac{\sum_{s \neq v \neq t \in V}\frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}}}{(|V|-1)(|V|-2)}
\end{equation} where $\sigma_{st}$ is the number of shortest paths from vertex $s$ to vertex $t$ and $\sigma_{st}(v)$ is the number of those shortest paths that pass through vertex $v$. 
% \B{v} = \frac{2 \cdot \sum_{s \neq v \neq t \in V,\ s < t}\frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}}}{(|V|-1)(|V|-2)}.
% \end{equation} where $\sigma_{st}$ is the number of shortest paths from vertex $s$ to vertex $t$ and $\sigma_{st}(v)$ is the number of those shortest paths that pass through vertex $v$. 
In the above definition, the denominator represents the total number of pairs of vertices except $v$.
It normalizes $\B{v}$ to a value between 0 and 1.
Given an undirected graph, $\sigma_{st}=\sigma_{ts}$ and $\sigma_{st}(v)=\sigma_{ts}(v)$ for all vertices $s$, $t$, and $v$.
Therefore, it is sufficient to find either $\sigma_{st}$ or $\sigma_{ts}$ and either $\sigma_{st}(v)$ or $\sigma_{ts}(v)$.

% The globally computed betweenness based on (\ref{bet}) requires much information about the whole network topology and causes large computational and message load overheads. Since a DTN node may be energy-constrained and there is usually no explicit centralized network node in a DTN, such computation is not reasonable. Thus, getting local information from encounter nodes and generating ego or x-ego networks in a distributed way are practically feasible.
% 
% A node $v$'s \emph{ego betweenness} $C^{\mathcal{E}}_{B}(v)$ on its ego network $\EN{v}$ is locally computed as follows:\begin{equation}\label{ebet}
% C^{\mathcal{E}}_{B}(v) = \frac{\sum_{s \neq v \neq t \in V_{1}^{v}, s<t}\frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}}}{(|V_{1}^{v}|-1)(|V_{1}^{v}|-2)/2}. 
% \end{equation} and the \emph{x-ego betweenness} $C^{\mathcal{X}}_{B}(v)$ on its x-ego network $\XN{v}$ is also locally obtained as follows: \begin{equation}\label{eebet}
% C^{\mathcal{X}}_{B}(v) = \frac{\sum_{s \neq v \neq t \in V_{2}^{v}, s<t}\frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}}}{(|V_{2}^{v}|-1)(|V_{2}^{v}|-2)/2}.
% \end{equation} Although the x-ego betweenness requires more computational time than the ego betweenness, it has the similar benefit of simplicity with the ego network in terms of information collection and network configuration. On the other hand, the x-ego betweenness includes more local information than the ego network, so that it will be more accurate than the ego betweenness. 

In a large wireless network, obtaining the betweenness of each node (i.e., the betweenness of the vertex representing that node) is costly since  all nodes that have limited memory and energy must exchange and consume a substantial number of messages to identify the shortest paths between them.
On the other hand, each node can obtain its ego and x-ego networks with much lower overhead since each node  needs to broadcast information about its 1-hop neighbors (Section~\ref{x-ego_definition}). 
In this paper, we consider the situations where each node computes its betweenness using either its ego network or x-ego network and then uses the result as an estimate of its true betweenness in the entire network.
We refer to the betweenness of $v$ computed from the ego network and x-ego network of $v$ as the {\em ego betweenness} and {\em x-ego betweenness} of $v$ (denoted $\BE{v}$ and $\BX{v}$), respectively.

% To compare the accuracy of $\BE{v}$ or $\BX{v}$, we first use the Spearman's rank correlation which measures the {\em monotonic} relationship between the ranked variables of $\BX{v}$ and $\B{v}$ or $\BE{v}$ and $\B{v}$.  The correlation value can vary between -1.0 and +1.0. The closer value is to +1.0, the stronger the association between the values. For the sake of completeness, we also measure the well-known Pearson correlation. The Pearson correlation coefficient assesses a {\em linear} relationship between the two variables and the calculation is based not on the ranked variables, but on the actual betweenness values.

% For the networks shown in Fig. \ref{}, Table \ref{comparison} shows the comparison of globally computed, ego, and x-ego betweenness. Although the actual betweenness values are different with each other, we can see that 1) the rank order of the three betweenness values are very similar to each other, and 2) the rank order of x-ego betweenness is more similar to the one of globally computed betweenness than the one of ego betweenness. We will verify the details with real mobility trace data in Section IV.

Table~\ref{comparison} shows, for every vertex $v$ in Fig.~\ref{eego}, the betweenness ($\B{v}$), ego betweenness ($\BE{v}$), and x-ego betweenness ($\BX{v}$).
In this table, for most of the vertices, x-ego betweenness is closer to betweenness than ego-betweenness mainly because it is derived from a larger number of vertices and edges.
For this reason, the correlation coefficient (also known as the Pearson correlation coefficient) of x-ego betweenness and betweenness (0.9) is higher than that of ego-betweenness and betweenness (0.63).
The advantage of x-ego betweenness over ego betweenness can also be observed in terms of Spearman's rank correlation, which indicates, given two series $\mathcal{X}=(X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_N)$ and $\mathcal{Y}=(Y_1, Y_2, \cdots, Y_N)$, the correlation between $(r_{\mathcal{X}}(X_1), r_{\mathcal{X}}(X_2)$ $, \cdots, r_{\mathcal{X}}(X_N))$ and $(r_{\mathcal{Y}}(Y_1), r_{\mathcal{Y}}(Y_2), \cdots, r_{\mathcal{Y}}(Y_N))$, where $r_{\mathcal{X}}(X_i)$ and $r_{\mathcal{Y}}(Y_i)$ represent the rank of $X_i$ in $\mathcal{X}$ and that of $Y_i$ in $\mathcal{Y}$, respectively.
In Table~\ref{comparison}, Spearman's correlation is 0.93 between x-ego betweenness and betweenness and 0.79 between ego betweenness and betweenness.
In Section~\ref{evaluation}, we further demonstrate the benefit of x-ego betweenness using wireless trace data.

\subsection{Properties of X-Ego Networks}\label{x-go_properties}
In this section, we present four properties of x-ego networks. 
These properties enable efficient x-ego betweenness computation (Section~\ref{computation}). 
As in Brandes' work~\cite{Brandes01afaster}, we denote the \emph{dependency} of vertices $s$ and $t$ on vertex $v$ as $\D{s}{t}{v} = \frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}}$.
Then, the betweenness of $v$ (Equation (\ref{bet})) can be computed by adding the dependency values for all pairs of vertices excluding $v$.
To quickly calculate such dependency values in x-ego networks, we have identified the properties explained below. 

% By Equation (\ref{bet}), we can know that the betweenness of $v$ can be obtained by summing the dependencies for all pairs of vertices, except for $v$, in $\XN{v}$.
% % The exhaustive search of such all shortest paths is computationally expensive. 
% We identify the following properties, {\em Theorem \ref{theorem1}, \ref{theorem2}, \ref{theorem3}}, and  {\em \ref{theorem4}}, to obtain such dependencies with low computational overhead.
% % Therefore, we need to devise {\em skip conditions} or (\ldots) to reduce the computational burden.  
\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem1} 
Assume a vertex $v$, its x-ego network $\XN{v}$, and its two different 1-hop neighbors $s$ and $t$ (i.e., $s, t \in \V{v}{1}$ and $s \ne t$).
Then, $\D{s}{t}{v} = 0$ if there is an edge between $s$ and $t$ (i.e., $\{s, t\} \in \E{v}{1}$).
\begin{proof}
Since $\{s, t\} \in \E{v}{1}$, $d(s, t) = 1$.
Furthermore, $s, t \in \V{v}{1}$, meaning that $d(s, v) + d(v, t) = 1 + 1 = 2 > d(s, t) = 1$ (i.e., no shortest path from $s$ to $t$ passes through $v$).
Therefore, $\D{s}{t}{v} = \sigma_{st}(v)/\sigma_{st} = 0/\sigma_{st} = 0$.\hfill\qed
\end{proof}
\end{theorem}


\begin{example}
In Fig.~\ref{eego2}(b), $\D{a}{b}{v} = 0$ since $a, b \in \V{v}{1}$ and there is an edge between $a$ and $b$.
\end{example}

% Theorem \ref{theorem1} will take on a key role as a computation skipping rule in the algorithm to compute the x-ego betweenness, $\BX{v}$. In particular, it will reduce the computational overload substantially when a vertex $v$'s x-ego network exhibits a strong community structure (i.e., nodes in ego networks tend to interact with each other). Since friends of a friend are likely to be friends as well, we can expect that this transitivity should be frequently observed in x-ego networks derived by a DTN. 
% 
% In case that the skipping rule presented by Theorem \ref{theorem1} cannot be applied for a pair of $v$'s two 1-hop neighbors, the dependency of them is computed by using the following Theorem \ref{theorem2}. 

Theorem \ref{theorem1} allows us to quickly compute dependencies particularly when x-ego networks exhibit a strong community structure (i.e., 1-hop neighbors of a node tend to have direct social links between them).
In Section~\ref{evaluation}, we show this benefit using wireless trace data.

When Theorem \ref{theorem1} cannot be applied to $v$'s 1-hop neighbors $s$ and $t$ (i.e., there is no edge between $s$ and $t$), the dependency of $s$ and $t$ on $v$ can be computed using the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem2} 
Assume a vertex $v$, its x-ego network $\XN{v}$, and its two different 1-hop neighbors $s$ and $t$ (i.e., $s, t \in \V{v}{1}$ and $s \ne t$).
Then, $\D{s}{t}{v} = {1}/{|\V{s}{1} \cap \V{t}{1}|}$ if there is no edge between $s$ and $t$ (i.e., $\{s, t\} \notin \E{v}{1}$).
\begin{proof}
Since $\{s, t\} \notin \E{v}{1}$, $d(s, t) > 1$.
In this case, $d(s, t) = 2$ due to the path $s - v - t$.
Furthermore, (i) the number of shortest paths from $s$ to $t$ (i.e., paths whose length is 2) can be expressed as $\sigma_{st} = |\V{s}{1} \cap \V{t}{1}|$.
%  indicates the number of shortest paths starting from $v_s \in N_0$ and terminating at $v_t \in N_0$.
On the other hand, (ii) the path $s-v-t$ is the only shortest path from $s$ to $t$ that passes through $v$ (i.e., $\sigma_{st}(v) = 1$) since the length of that path is 2, which must be smaller than the length of any other path from $s$ to $t$ that passes through $v$.
By (i) and (ii), $\D{s}{t}{v} = \sigma_{st}(v)/\sigma_{st} = {1}/{|\V{s}{1} \cap \V{t}{1}|}$.\hfill\qed

% \D{s}{t}{v} =
%   \begin{cases}
%    0       & \text{if $(s, t) \in E$} \\
%    {\displaystyle \frac {1}{|\V{s}{1} \cap \V{t}{1}|}} & \text{ otherwise.} \\
%   \end{cases}
% \end{equation}

\begin{example}
\label{example2} 
In Fig.~\ref{eego2}(b), vertices $a$ and $c$ are 1-hop neighbors of $v$ and there is no edge between $a$ and $c$.
Furthermore, $\V{a}{1} = \lbrace b, e, f, g, v\rbrace$ and $\V{c}{1} = \lbrace d, g, h, v\rbrace$.
Therefore, $\D{a}{c}{v}=1/|\V{a}{1} \cap \V{c}{1}|=1/|\{g, v \}|=1/2$.

% $\LV{a}{1} = \lbrace v, b, e, f, g\rbrace$, $\LV{c}{1} = \lbrace v, d, g, h\rbrace$ and $\LV{d}{1} = \lbrace v, c, h, i\rbrace$. So, node $v$ can get the non-zero $\D{a}{c}{v}=1/2=0.5$ and $\D{a}{d}{v}=1/1=1$ because $v$ knows that $a$ does not share any edge with $c$ and $d$, $|\LV{a}{1} \cap \LV{c}{1}| = |\lbrace v, g\rbrace|=2$, and $|\LV{a}{1} \cap \LV{d}{1}| = |\lbrace v\rbrace$| = 1. 
\end{example}

Just like Theorem~\ref{theorem1}, the following theorem quickly computes the dependency of two vertices on a vertex $v$.
While the former applies to a pair of 1-hop neighbors of $v$, the latter applies to a pair of a 1-hop or 2-hop neighbor and a 2 hop-neighbor of $v$.
% The following Theorem \ref{theorem3} presents another skipping rule to reduce the computation overload of the dependency for an 1 or 2-hop neighbor and a 2-hop neighbor of $v$.

\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem3} 
Assume a vertex $v$, its x-ego network $\XN{v}$, a vertex $s \in \LV{v}{2}$, and another vertex $t \in \V{v}{2}$ such that $s \ne t$.
Then, $\D{s}{t}{v} = 0$ if $\D{s}{n}{v} = 0$ for a 1-hop neighbor vertex $n$ of vertex $t$ (i.e., for $n \in \V{t}{1}$).
\begin{proof}
Since $\D{s}{n}{v} = 0$ (i.e., no shortest path from $s$ to $n$ passes through $v$), (i) $d(s, n) < d(s, v) +d(v, n)$.
Then, (ii) $d(s, t) \le d(s, n) + d(n, t) < d(s, v) + d(v, n) + d(n, t)$ by (i).
Furthermore, $n \in \V{t}{1}$ and $t \in \V{v}{2}$, meaning that vertex $n$ is either a 1-hop or a 3-hop neighbor of $v$.
In $\XN{v}$, however, any vertex including $n$ is at most 2 hops away from $v$.
For this reason, $n$ is a 1-hop neighbor of $v$.
Since $d(v, n)$=$d(n, t)$=$1$ and $d(v, t)=2$, (iii) $d(v, n) + d(n, t) = d(v, t)$. 
By (ii) and (iii), $d(s, t) < d(s, v) +d(v, t)$ (i.e., no shortest path from $s$ to $t$ passes through $v$).
Therefore, $\D{s}{t}{v}  = \sigma_{st}(v)/\sigma_{st} = 0/\sigma_{st} = 0$.\hfill\qed
\end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
In Fig. \ref{eego2}(b), $b \in \LV{v}{2}$ and $g \in \V{v}{2}$. 
Furthermore, for a 1-hop neighbor $a$ of $g$, $\D{b}{a}{v}=0$ (Theorem \ref{theorem1}).
Therefore, by Theorem \ref{theorem3}, $\D{b}{g}{v}=0$.
\end{example}

Given vertices $s \in \LV{v}{2}$ and $t \in \V{v}{2}$ such that $s \ne t$, Theorem~\ref{theorem3} cannot be applied if $\D{s}{n}{v} > 0$ for every 1-hop neighbor $n$ of $t$.
In this case, the dependency of $s$ and $t$ on $v$ can be obtained using the following theorem.
% Lastly, the following Theorem \ref{theorem4} presents that the harmonic mean can be used to compute the dependency for an 1 or 2-hop neighbor and a 2-hop neighbor of $v$, if they do not satisfy the condition of Theorem \ref{theorem3}. 

\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem4} 
Assume a vertex $v$, its x-ego network $\XN{v}$, a vertex $s \in \LV{v}{2}$, and another vertex $t \in \V{v}{2}$ such that $s \ne t$.
Then, $\D{s}{t}{v} = \bar{H}(\{\D{s}{n}{v} : n \in \V{t}{1}\})$ if $\D{s}{n}{v} > 0$ for every 1-hop neighbor $n$ of vertex $t$, where $\bar{H}(\{\D{s}{n}{v} : n \in \V{t}{1}\})$ denotes the {\em harmonic mean} computed over $\{\D{s}{n}{v} : n \in \V{t}{1}\}$.
\begin{proof}
We prove this theorem considering the following two cases.
% in two cases, $s \in \LV{v}{1}$ or $s \in \LV{v}{2}-\LV{v}{1}$, separately:

\noindent [Case I. $s$ is a 1-hop neighbor of $v$ (i.e., $s \in \V{v}{1}$)]
% Let us assume there are $m$ 1-hop neighbors of $t$ in $\XN{v}$ and let $n_i$ denote the $i$th 1-hop neighbor of $t$ such that $\D{s}{n_i}{v} > 0$. In $\XN{v}$, each $n_i$ is also an 1-hop neighbor of $v$ (i.e., $n_i \in \LV{v}{1}$) and $\D{s}{n_i}{v} = {1}/{|\LV{s}{1} \cap \LV{n_i}{1}|}$ by Theorem \ref{theorem2}. 
% Furthermore, (i) $|\LV{s}{1} \cap \LV{n_i}{1}|=1/\D{s}{n_i}{v}$ represents the number of shortest paths from $s$ to $n_i$ (i.e., $\sigma_{sn_i}$) and the total number of shortest paths from $s$ to $t$ can be expressed as $\sigma_{st} = \sum_{i=1}^m 1/\D{s}{n_i}{v}$ since each $n_i$ shares an edge with $t$. On the other hand, (ii) the path $s-v-n_i-t$ is the only shortest path from $s$ to $t$ via both $v$ and $n_i$ since the length of the path is 3 and any other path from $s$ to $t$ via both $v$ and $n_i$ must be longer. It means that there are $m$ shortest paths from $s$ to $t$ via $v$ (i.e., $\sigma_{st}(v)=m$). By (i) and (ii), $\D{s}{t}{v} = \frac{m}{\sum_{i=1}^m 1/\D{s}{n_i}{v}} = \bar{H}(\D{s}{n}{v})$.
Let $n_i$ ($i=1,2,\cdots, m$) denote the $i$th 1-hop neighbor of $t$.
Then, each $n_i$ is a 1-hop neighbor of $v$ since, in $\XN{v}$, any 2-hop neighbor (including $t$) of $v$ can be connected only to a 1-hop neighbor of $v$ (Definition~\ref{def:xego-network}).
Thus, by Theorem \ref{theorem2}, $\D{s}{n_i}{v} = {1}/{|\V{s}{1} \cap \V{n_i}{1}|}$. 
Since $|\V{s}{1} \cap \V{n_i}{1}|$ represents the number of shortest paths from $s$ to $n_i$ (i.e., $\sigma_{sn_i}$) and each $n_i$ has an edge to $t$, the total number of shortest paths from $s$ to $t$ can be expressed as (i) $\sigma_{st} = \sum_{i=1}^m |\V{s}{1} \cap \V{n_i}{1}| = \sum_{i=1}^m 1/\D{s}{n_i}{v}$. 
On the other hand, the path $s-v-n_i-t$ is the only shortest path from $s$ to $t$ via both $v$ and $n_i$ since the length of the path is 3 and any other path from $s$ to $t$ via both $v$ and $n_i$ must be longer.
For this reason, (ii) there are $m$ shortest paths from $s$ to $t$ via $v$ (i.e., $\sigma_{st}(v)=m$).
By (i) and (ii), $\D{s}{t}{v} = \frac{m}{\sum_{i=1}^m 1/\D{s}{n_i}{v}} = \bar{H}(\D{s}{n}{v})$.

\noindent [Case II. $s$ is a 2-hop neighbor of $v$ (i.e., $s \in \V{v}{2}$)]
Let $n_i~(i=1,2,\cdots,m)$ denote the $i$th 1-hop neighbor of $t$. 
Let also $p_j~(j=1,2,\cdots,k)$ denote the $j$th 1-hop neighbor of $s$.
In $\XN{v}$, 2-hop neighbors (including $s$ and $t$) of $v$ can be connected only to a 1-hop neighbor of $v$.
For this reason, any shortest path from $s$ to $t$ must contain a shortest path from $p_j$ to $n_i$ for some $j$ and $i$ 
% Since $n_i$ and $p_j$ respectively shares an edge with $t$ and $s$, the shortest path from $n_i$ to $n_j$ for a pair of $i$ and $j$ always corresponds to the one from $s$ to $t$ 
(i.e., $\sigma_{st} = \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^k |\V{n_i}{1} \cap \V{p_j}{1}|$). 
For a pair of $i$ and $j$, on the other hand, the path $n_i-v-p_j$ is the only shortest path from $n_i$ to $p_j$ via $v$ and so is the path $t-n_i-v-p_j-s$ (i.e., $\sigma_{st}(v)=mk$). 
Therefore, 
\begin{eqnarray}
\D{s}{t}{v} 
&=& \frac{mk}{\sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^k |\V{n_i}{1} \cap \V{p_j}{1}|} \nonumber \\ 
&=& \frac{mk}{\sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^k 1/\D{n_i}{p_j}{v}} \nonumber \\ 
&=& \frac{m}{\sum_{i=1}^m \frac {\sum_{j=1}^k 1/\D{n_i}{p_j}{v}}{k}} \nonumber \\ 
&=& \frac{m}{\sum_{i=1}^m 1/\D{n_i}{s}{v}} \nonumber \\ 
&=& \frac{m}{\sum_{i=1}^m 1/\D{s}{n_i}{v}} \nonumber  \\
&=& \bar{H}(\D{s}{n}{v}).   \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}\qed

% \label{harmonic} 
% For a vertex $v$, its x-ego network $\XN{v}$, a vertex $s \in \V{v}{1} \cup \V{v}{2}$ and another vertex $t \in \V{v}{2}$, let $n_1, n_2, \cdots, n_i$ ($n_i \leq u$) denote the 1-hop neighbor vertices of vertex $t$. 
% Then, 
% \begin{equation}
% \D{s}{t}{v} =
%   \begin{cases}
%    0      &\text{if $\exists k, \D{s}{n_k}{v} = 0$} \\
%    \bar H (\D{s}{n_k}{v}) &\text{otherwise.}
%    \end{cases}
% \end{equation} where $\bar H_{st}$ is the harmonic mean for all the non-zero $f_{s{n_k}}$ values.

\begin{example}
In Fig.~\ref{eego2}(b), % consider the dependency $\D{a}{h}{v}$ of $a \in \LV{v}{2}$ and $h \in \V{v}{2}$ on $v$. In this example, 
$\V{h}{1} = \{c,d\}$.
By Theorem \ref{theorem2}, $\D{a}{c}{v}=\frac{1}{2}$ and $\D{a}{d}{v}=1$.
Therefore, by Theorem \ref{theorem4}, $\D{a}{h}{v}\!=\!\bar{H}(\{\D{a}{n}{v} : n \in \V{h}{1}\})\!=\!\bar{H}(\{\D{a}{c}{v},\D{a}{d}{v}\})\!=\!\frac{2}{\frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}} + \frac{1}{1}}=\frac{2}{3}$.  
 
% For each 1-hop neighbor $n$ of $h$ (i.e., $n \in \V{h}{1} = \{ c,d\}$,  and from Theorem \ref{theorem2} it also knows $\D{a}{c}{v}=1/2$ and $\D{a}{d}{v}=1/1$ for $h$'s two 1-hop neighbors, $c$ and $d$. Therefore, we can get $\D{a}{h}{v}$=$\bar{H}(\D{a}{c}{v},\D{a}{d}{v})$=$2/3$. 
% Similarly, $\D{c}{e}{v}=\bar{H}(\D{c}{a}{v})=1/2$ where $c \in \LV{v}{1} (\subset \LV{v}{2})$ and $e \in \LV{v}{2}-\LV{v}{1}$, since $\LV{e}{1}=\{e,a\}$, $\D{c}{a}{v}=1/2$ and $\bar{H}(\D{c}{a}{v})=\D{c}{a}{v}$.
\end{example}

% These four properties will be used in the algorithm proposed in Section \ref{computation} to compute the x-ego betweenness of a DTN node.
