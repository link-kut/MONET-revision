\begin{abstract}
% In delay-tolerant networks, the betweenness centrality measure has been used to identify the relative important nodes in terms of the efficient delivery of messages. 
In wireless networks, the betweenness of a node has been considered an indication of that node's importance in efficiently and reliably delivering messages.
% Since the time complexity to compute the betweenness centrality is very high, it is difficult to get the centrality of each node in a large-scale delay-tolerant network. 
In a large wireless network, however, the cost of computing the betweenness of every node is impractically high.
% In this paper, we define a new type of local network called the \emph{Expanded Ego Network} built only with each node's local neighbor information and also provide a new measure called the \emph{Expanded Ego Betweenness Centrality} to estimate a node's betweenness centrality. 
In this paper, we introduce a new representation of a node's vicinity, called the \emph{expanded ego network} (shortly, \emph{x-ego network}) of that node.
We also propose an approach that calculates the \emph{x-ego betweenness} of a node (i.e., the betweenness of that node in its x-ego network) and use it as an estimate of the true betweenness in the entire network.
Furthermore, we develop an algorithm that quickly computes x-ego betweenness by exploiting structural properties of x-ego networks.
Our evaluation results show the benefits and effectiveness of the above approach using trace data obtained from real-world wireless networks.

%We examine that the relationship among the expanded ego betweenness, the ego betweenness and the betweenness of the entire network for a node.




%Each nodes can compare their own locally calculated expanded ego betweenness value, without high complexity calculation


%Since the expended ego network can be easily self-configured at a node and it can contain more network information than the ego network, it can be used to compare each node's importance relatively.
