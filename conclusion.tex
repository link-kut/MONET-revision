\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}
% In this paper, we proposed a new type of logical network called {\em x-ego network} and a new measure called {\em x-ego betweenness} to estimate a DTN node's real betweenness well. 
% We also provided four properties of x-ego networks and proposed an efficient algorithm based on the four properties to compute x-ego betweenness. 
% The proposed algorithm focuses to compute betweenness centrality of only one ego node in a given x-ego network, which is the essential reason why the skip ratio for {\em dependency1} and {\em dependency2} is significantly high. 
% On the other hand, the Brandes algorithm tries to compute betweenness centrality of all nodes in a given network. 
% This difference makes the proposed algorithm more superior to the Brandes algorithm when an x-ego network is given and its ego node's betweenness centrality is concerned. 
% 
% We believe that the proposed x-ego betweenness and algorithm have a wider applicability to many socially-aware DTN routing schemes where a node with high betweenness centrality has been mainly used as message mediator.

In wireless networks, relaying messages via nodes with high betweenness centrality improves both the efficiency and reliability of message delivery.
Computing the betweenness of each node, however, incurs impractically high network and computational overhead.
In our approach, each node constructs its {\em x-ego network}, a logical network capturing the social links in its vicinity, and then computes its {\em x-ego betweenness} (i.e., its betweenness in its x-ego network) as an estimate of its true betweenness in the wireless network.
By taking advantage of structural properties of x-ego networks, our algorithm quickly computes x-ego betweenness.
Our evaluation results demonstrate that x-ego betweenness accurately estimates betweenness and our algorithm more quickly computes x-ego betweenness than the state-of-the-art betweenness computation algorithm
